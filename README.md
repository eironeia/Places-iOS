# Places app

## Description

Using the device location, fetch the nearby places using Google Places API and display a list of results.

## Requirements

* Fetch Nearby Places based on your Device Location;
* Use Google Places API endpoint.
  * Do NOT use any SDK or library that wraps the Places API;
  * Filter on Bars, Cafes & Restaurants;
* Provide Loading, Success and Error handling.
* Each place detail should display at least: Place, Name, Open now and Rating;
* Sort the list by Rating;
* When selecting a Place, provide a Detail View that holds additional information.
    * For example: Image or User Reviews.
* Extra: Provide additional sorting options, for example: Name, Open/Closed, Distance.

## Engineering instructions
* Developed in Swift, using an architectural design pattern of your choice;
* Provide relevant testing;
* Support for iOS11+, iPhone only.
* You can use any third party library that you want, given properly argumented.
* The choice for UI / UX is all yours. Be professional, but donâ€™t spend too much time here.

### Architecture

My decision for the architecture has been use **MVVM**. The reason behind that is that I am familiar with it and since the models from the API doesn't require high amount of modification in terms of getting presented, I didn't chose an approach as it could be **VIPER** or **VIP**. Also I use Repository for the Network layer (**MVVM-CR**).

Other patterns that I have used are **Coordinator pattern** for handling the navigation. **Factory pattern** in order to create dependencies in a way that can easily be tested. 

### Frameworks used

* **RxSwift & RxCocoa:** Benefits from RxSwift and RxCocoa are multiples as simplified Asynchronous declative code and multithreading, therefore you endup having a cleaner and more readable code and architecture. Allows composability. It's multi platform, which means if you learn it in Swift you will be able to use it in any other of the other languages that supports it (http://reactivex.io/languages.html). It's open source which means that has a huge community behind it, which means that likelihood of not being up to date it's unlikely. The downsides of this framework, which it's possible that will easily integrate all over the place in your aapp, are learning process at the beginning it's going to seem rough, but worth it on my opinion. Since you will be working with asynchronous code it might lead to memory leaks if not handled properly. Last one is debugging, usually has a big stack trace which make it sometimes hard to find the issue.

* **PKHUD:** Used for the loader. I didn't want to necessarily spend so many time on creating a loader since UI was important but not critical. I have had experience with this framework and it has really nice and easy integration.

### Future improvements

- [ ] Abstract loader
